Automated process description

Brandon Reppert, Alex Sjoberg, Phil Brocker, Seungyoung Ji
------------------------------------------------------------
we loop through pioneers games, starting up the server in a different terminal window, and then we start the client for that server.
We can run however many games we want

After all of the simulations are complete, we have a simple python parser to gather and then print out the results

In our results, we will calculate the number of wins for all players

We will then calculate win % for us.
